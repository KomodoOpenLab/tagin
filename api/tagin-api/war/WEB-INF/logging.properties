# A default java.util.logging configuration.
# (All App Engine logging is through java.util.logging by default).
#
# To use this configuration, copy it into your application's WEB-INF
# folder and add the following to your appengine-web.xml:
# 
# <system-properties>
#   <property name="java.util.logging.config.file" value="WEB-INF/logging.properties"/>
# </system-properties>
#

# Specify the handlers to create in the root logger
# (all loggers are children of the root logger)
# The following creates the console handler
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Set the default logging level for the root logger
.level = WARNING

# Set the default logging level for the datanucleus loggers
DataNucleus.level=WARNING
org.datanucleus.store.types.sco.SCOUtils.level=OFF

# We assume that people will generally want to see this message, even
# if they override the root level to WARNING.  If they really want to
# turn it off, they can always override this level as well.
